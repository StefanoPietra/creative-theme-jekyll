                <p class="text-faded">I'm Stefano, I’m from Italy and after living for several years in London I've now moved to Stockholm.<br><br>
                My background is in life sciences, I’ve studied cell and molecular biology and worked as a postdoctoral researcher in academia. After deciding to transition towards a career in data science, I’ve started to learn Python on my own with free online resources and then pursued a certificate in data analytics to strengthen my foundations and gather more hands-on coding experience.<br><br>
                Among my recent projects there’s one to automate scraping board game prices from specialist websites and one to systematically build a map of South America with Google Maps screenshots. I’m currently working on a project to find patterns of protein oxidation during the cell cycle and to build a model capable of predicting these patterns. Future plans include analysing some web traffic and marketing data from <a href="https://www.brickborrow.it/">Brickborrow.it</a>.<br><br>
                I like strategy games, tasting new food, playing tennis and basketball, and <s>in a few weeks I will hike</s> I successfully hiked the West Highland Way in Scotland.</p>
